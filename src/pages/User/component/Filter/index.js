        The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small
        space through progressive disclosure. The user gets key details about
        the underlying content and can choose to expand that content within the
        constraints of the accordion. Accordions work especially well on mobile
        interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a premium.
